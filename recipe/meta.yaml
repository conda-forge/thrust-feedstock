  summary: Thrust is a C++ parallel programming library which resembles the C++ Standard Library.
  description: |
    Thrust's high-level interface greatly enhances programmer productivity while enabling
    performance portability between GPUs and multicore CPUs. Interoperability with established
    technologies (such as CUDA, TBB, and OpenMP) facilitates integration with existing software.
    Develop high-performance applications rapidly with Thrust!
